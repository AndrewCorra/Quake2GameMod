Welcome to the Elements mod!
Press F1-F5 for an element! Remember, you can't change this for the rest of the match.
F1 is Fire, which causes burn damage and gives you fire particle effects on your bullets.
F2 is Ice, which causes your attacks to slow on hit and gives your attacks "icy" particle effects.
F3 is Earth, which gives you a healing effect when damaging an enemy and increases the amount of bullets fired by your shotgun(s).
F4 is Air, which gives you decreased gravity and higher jump when damaging an enemy.
Finally, F5 is Chaos, which switches randomly between the other 4 every 30 seconds!
Deal damage to entities to gain XP and level up! As you level up, your buffs/debuff apply more stacks per shot, maxing out at doubling at level 3.
Have fun!
